'    1. All the code you see is derived from my own sweat and sleepless nights.
'         To make a long story short, it's all Copyright by me, so no matter
'         how flattering, please contact me before using any of my code.  I'll almost
'         always say yes, but that way it will be legal.

'    2. This was created under a short deadline, and I had only a year of
'         programming experience (a year being one class prior).  Allot of the
'         code is done inefficiently, and simply a quick solution to something
'         that seemed to be going wrong when debugging it.  (Hmm ... what if I
'         add 1 to i ... nope ... I'll subtract 1).
'       By no means is this a place to get good, rock solid functions.  It's
'         to get ideas, and help understand how you'd go about making a more
'         complex game in Visual Basic.  (Check Marque Castle Redux for better
'         functions when it is complete).

'    Sound effects for "Defeat" and "Water" made by me, others from from "Resident
'      Evil."  Theme Music from unknown ... sorry whoever ... ending music from
'      "EarthBound."  All other songs came with my Yamaha Midi XGPlayer.
